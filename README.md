Text-based Fighting game
In this text based fighting game, there is a player that fights against several opponents. The goal of this game is to defeat the challenger. You do so by winning your battle. There are two one on one battles, and the winners from both battles then duel and the winner out of that then gets to challenge the final boss. If the player is able to defeat the final boss, then they have won the game. If the payer dies at any point, the player loses. 
There are 4 characters the player can choose from: Ishiguro, Risotto Nero, Piano and Forto. These 4 characters are based off of the four fundamental forces. Ishiguro is based off of gravity, Risotto Nero is based off of electromagnetism, Piano is based off of the weak forces and Forto is based off of strong forces. Each character has several stats which determines how they will be involved in the game and interact with their opponents.   
The game is played by selecting an attack by typing the number that the attack is associated with until the opponent is defeated. The player then moves on the next opponent.
